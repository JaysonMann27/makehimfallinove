            <p>Do you ever get a gut feeling about someone the instant you meet them?</p>
            <p>When that happens, you know it’s not because of what they said or did. It’s some kind of signal you read in their facial expression, vocal tone, or body language.</p>
            <p>Surprisingly, researchers have found that we are quite accurate with these instantaneous assessments about other people.</p>
            <p>The simple fact is, you know things about a person the second you meet them. And you react to these unspoken signals automatically.</p>
            <p>If you’re good at reading people, you may not find it surprising to learn that men and women notice different kinds of signals when interacting with a potential mate. </p>
            <div class="alert alert-success" role="alert"><p>To skip ahead to the video that explains the unusual pattern of signals men look for in a romantic relationship, just follow <a href="https://hissecretobsession.com/freepresentation.php?vtid=makehimwantyou"><strong>this link.</strong></a></p>
            <p> It explains the hidden signal that either repels a man or makes him feel irresistibly attracted to you.</p></div>
            <p>Otherwise, keep reading to learn about a particular signal you’re broadcasting to men all the time (whether you know it or not).</p>
            <p> It’s probably not what you would expect. </p>
            <p>You see, there’s a specific kind of body language men simply can’t ignore.</p>
            <p> It’s a signal that can spark romantic feelings. Or it can repel him, depending on what he’s reading from your nonverbal cues. </p>
            <p>Would you like to know what it is?</p>

            <h3>Men Are Extremely Sensitive to Something in Your Body Language That You Would Never Expect.</h3>
            <p>Women often ask me for the words to make a man want you. But the secret to make someone fall in love with you goes a bit deeper.</p>
            <p>In fact, your ability to broadcast the right non-verbal message makes all the difference when it comes to attracting the kind of man you want. </p>
            <p>If you’ve been attracting attention from guys who fail to connect with you on a deep, emotional level, I may be able to show you why.</p>
            <p> You’re probably sending out just one very confusing signal...without even realizing it.</p>

            <h3>With the wrong signal, you end up with this:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Attention from the wrong kind of guys. The ones you aren’t interested in.</li>
              <li>Initial attraction that later fades with the one guy you really wanted to attract.</li>
              <li>A slow and painful death for the attraction and passion in your existing relationship.</li>
            </ul>
            <br /><h3>But with a slight adjustment, you could be sending the right signal all the time. And you’d end up getting results more like this:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Passion that intensifies the longer you’re together</li>
              <li>A guy who clearly feels protective of you </li>
              <li>A deep feeling of private exclusivity as he lets you into his inner world</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The difference can be dramatic. And it all comes down to this one signal I’m about to show you. </p>
            <p>In order to explain this signal, think of yourself as a radio tower.</p>

            <h3>You are constantly broadcasting a message to the men in your life. And there’s one “channel” he can’t tune out.</h3>
            <p>That’s because men have emotional “antennas” designed specifically to detect this one kind of signal. </p>
            <p>Ready to find out which signal I’m talking about? Ok, here it is. He reads your nonverbal cues to find out where you “rank him” compared with other men.</p>
            <p>He reads your body language to see how he measures up in your eyes. Does she respect me? Or am I just her play thing?</p>
            <p>Does she look up to me in some ways?  Does she value me compared to other men? Or is she just settling? </p>
            <br /><h3>Why are men so sensitive to this one signal? </h3>
            <p>Because, oddly enough, this signal tells him how you compare him to other men.  So it influences how he feels about himself whenever he’s around you. </p>
            <p>And it’s amazing how much this one signal affects his emotions. </p>
            <p>You see, in relationships, people don’t tell us what we really want to know. We have to listen to what’s written between the lines. </p>

         <div class="col-md-2"></div>
          <div class="col-md-8">
            <p>This kind of “listening” determines how we feel about each person we meet. And when it comes to romantic relationships, it tells us far more than spoken words.</p>
            <h3>Now tell me this. Which man would you rather commit to for life? </h3>
             <p>A man who compliments your beauty but seems to have difficulty keeping his eyes off other women? Or a man who is reserved with his compliments, but seems to have eyes only for you? </p>
            <p>The truth is, no one wants to end up with someone who is just settling. Instead, you want to feel desired. </p>
            <p>Men are no different. But what makes men feel desired is very different from what makes women feel desired.  </p>
            <p>For example, research shows men often confuse love and respect. A man does not want to be loved by a romantic partner unless she also holds him in high regard compared with other men. </p>
            <p>Otherwise, it just feels like motherly love. That’s not what he wants. It’s not how he wants to perceive himself in his primary relationship.</p>
            <p>And that’s why...</p>

            <h3>Women often send mixed signals to the guy they’re interested in without even knowing it.</h3>
            <p>It happens accidentally. And I have to tell you, it’s not your fault.</p>
            <p>Society has changed too fast for men and women to adapt to the rapid changes. We are left scrambling. </p>
            <p>In nearly every culture there used to be a clear set of expectations. Those expectations guided men and women through the process of connecting with a lifelong partner. </p>
            <br /><h3>Demonstrations of mutual admiration were built into the process of courtship.</h3>
            <p>But those clear expectations are a thing of the past.  These days, each couple has to invent their own path, dancing around unspoken expectations and feelings of uncertainty.</p>
            <p>And there’s something that often gets lost in our modern version of courtship. </p>
            <p>I’m talking about the ancient art of communicating desire through the language of admiration. It’s where the phrase, “You have an admirer” came from. </p>

            <h3>He doesn’t want you to settle.</h3>
            <p> He wants to feel like you see him as the ultimate catch. </p>
            <p>Otherwise, it deflates his ego.  And with it, his passion for the relationship deflates too.</p>
            <p> He just can’t picture himself with a woman who looks up to other men more than she looks up to him. </p>
            <p>But this is where things get confusing.</p>
            <br /><h3> Many women want to make their man feel loved.</h3>
            <p>  But a woman’s idea of loving communication is very different than a man’s.  </p>
            <p>How do you communicate your true feelings to a man? And why are men so sensitive to tiny signals about where you rank him compared with other men?</p>
            <p>To dive a little deeper into that particular question, I put together a <a href="https://hissecretobsession.com/freepresentation.php?vtid=makehimwantyou">video presentation on the topic.</a></p>

          <p>After watching <a href="https://hop.clickbank.net/?affiliate=Jaymann&vendor=hissecret&lp=0"><strong>this video</strong></a>, many women are surprised to learn how much control they have over a man’s self-esteem.</p>
          <p> And even more surprised by how easy it is to make someone cherish you and want to invest in the relationship. </p>
          <p>Many of us have a tendency to buy gifts of the sort we would like to receive ourselves. It can be like that with love. We try to love our partner the way we want to be loved. </p>
          <p>So you make him feel special. Yet he seems unaffected by that. You speak your own native love language to him. Apparently, he speaks another.</p>
          <p>But I’m here to tell you about one <a href="https://hop.clickbank.net/?affiliate=Jaymann&vendor=hissecret&lp=0"><strong>incredible, universal method</strong></a> you can use to grab his attention by showing that you get what he craves most. </p>
